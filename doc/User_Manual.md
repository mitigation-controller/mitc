_The MitC software is currently under development and in a pre-release state._

The ongoing research deals with the development of an automated risk-mitigation tool for construction projects, namely the Mitigation Controller (MitC). MitC is a state-of-the-art tool that can assist project managers to have a full grip on the progress of their running construction projects. It takes as input a complete project schedule and returns several outputs that help the project manager take actions to prevent potential delays. 

The source code was developed and tested with MATLAB R2019a.

Work done by:

* Omar Kammouh: Algorithm development
* Maurits Kok: GUI development
* Maria Nogal Macho: Supervision and Software maintenance
